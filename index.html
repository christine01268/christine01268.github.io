		<h1>Build Your Design Challenge Unit 2, by Christine Bolton</h1>
		<h2>Which websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>Two websites which inspire me are <a href="everest.com">Everest</a> and <a href="everlane.com">Everlane</a>.</p>
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>Everlane groups text into headers, sub-headers and text underneath. There is lots of negative space padding the objects on the page, and balance is achieved by placing pictures on the opposite side of bundles of text. Hierarchy is established with a focal point of a large picture, an option to shop men or women, and finall a menu of tabs at the top (surrounded by white negative space). Viewers are indicated to scroll below the fold for more content with the statement "High Quality, Low Markups. Here's how we do it."</p>
		<p>Everest, on the other hand, is a site made to serve a much different functionality, and the design reflects that. The whole screen consists of animated, high definition clips which the viewer is immediately drawn to - this background video is the focal point of the site. After watching the clips for a few moments, the viewer notices the text on the left and the call to action to download the iPhone app (in smaller text). In even smaller text, there are a few other options which seem much less important and don't demand much attention. The logo is small and unobtrusive - it serves no function and has no link, but the viewer should know what it looks like if they intend to download the app. Although there is technically no negative space, it is still easy to distinguish clickable elements from the background.</p>
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>The Everlane site offers a lot of information and different options on the landing page. You can select "Men/Women," which appears to be the main call to action for the viewers, or you can choose more options at the top, or you can scroll down to learn about the company's business model. These different options are frame appropriately with generous white negative space. Every, on the other hand, contains no content below the fold and relies on a series of eye-catching and high-resolution video clips, which comprise the entire background of the page, and the statement of "Your life is comprised of many journeys - chronicle them with Everest," to inspire desire in the viewer. The focus is on one single call to action: getting viewers to download the mobile app. All other actions (Journal, Help, Privacy) seem unimportant and secondary. The logo has no clickable function. It is also less conventional in that the background video is where the negative space would be, but the call to action is still pretty clear. The most appealing similarity between the two is the ease with which the focal point and call to action can be distinguished. For Everlane, it is the large picture and choice to shop Men or Women. For Everest, it is the high-resolution video clip which leads tthe viewer to click to download the app, and the link to download is very easily distinguishable against the other less impostant elements. Both sites use space and text size to establish hierarchy effectively.</p>
		<h2>My Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
		<p>In my opinion, the most appealing thumbnail sketches are those which are minimalist and exact. They should clearly convey the position of headers, sub-headers and text, but leave details of images to be added later. Below are a few thumbnail sketches which I drew to convey some ideas for a portfolio website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Homepage / Work Examples #1</strong><br><br>
				<img src="HomepageWireframe1.png" alt="Homepage Wireframe1"><br>This is one possible version of the home page, which in this case is also the page where I display my work experiences. The focal point would be the main picture in the center of the page, which would display an example of my most recent work, with arrows on both sides where the viewer can scroll through more examples. From there, the viewer would be drawn to a logo (which would be my name), and finally to a brief list of navigation options which includes just "Work," "About," and "Contact."</li><br>
			<li><strong>Homepage / Work Examples #2</strong><br><br>
				<img src="HomepageWireframe2.png" alt="Homepage Wireframe2"><br>Another version of the home page, inspired more by Everest.com, would feature a high-resolution image with the greeting of "Hi! I'm Christine" and a few brief statements to pique the viewer's interest. After seeing this photo and reading the introductory blurb, the viewer's attention would then turn to "See my work" with an arrow indicating that they should scroll to see more content below the fold. The menu buttons at the top would be the smallest text on the page and would feature a logo and three simple navigation options: "Work," "About," or "Contact." </li><br>
